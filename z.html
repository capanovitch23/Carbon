								<h2>1. Reducing Energy usage through your computer.</h2>
								<p>

									Reducing energy consumption in your home is a large part of shrinking your carbon footprint. Shutting down your computer when you're not using it is a simple and easy way to minimize your energy usage. Computers are some of the largest energy users in our home, and powering it off when you're not using is not only beneficial to you, but also the earth.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="infslide">
								<h2>2. Unplug chargers not being used.</h2>
								<p>

									Be sure to unplug your chargers when they are not being used. Some chargers will still use a small amount of power when they're not being used. So whether you are using a phone charger, calculator charger, or even a car charger, you can unplug it, and help the earth. Remember, a little goes a long way. 
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="infslide">
								<h2>3. Wash your clothes in eco-friendly ways.</h2>
								<p>

									Washing your clothes correctly is another small way you are able to do your part. If you wash your clothes in cold water, it would eliminate hot water usage, causing you to use less energy. You could also only wash your clothes when you have a full load of laundry. This will cause you to have to run your washing machine less, meaning that you will have less energy being wasted.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="infslide">
								<h2>4. Thaw your Foods in ways to prevent energy waste.</h2>
								<p>

									Another small way you can help, is to thaw your frozen foods in the fridge, instead of on a counter. This will help keep your fridge cold, because instead of wasting the coldness of your food, it will be put into your fridge, and keep your fridge cooler, while using less energy.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="infslide">
								<h2>5. Find substitutes to driving.</h2>
								<p>

									When you have short trips to take, instead of driving, consider riding a bike, or even walking. It is not always necessary to drive a car everywhere you go.Not only will it add exercise to your schedule, but it will also help you keep your gas usage down.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="infslide">
								<h2>6. Buy produce locally.</h2>
								<p>
									By buying more locally grown produce, you can lower your food miles. Meaning that less transport would be used to get your food from the farm, to your dinner table. So not only are you helping small, local businesses, you would be keeping transport down.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="infslide">
								<h2>7. Go Paperless.</h2>
								<p>
									Turing a single tree into paper can produce more than 110 lbs of carbon into the air. Instead, make your documents digital. If your job allows you to receive information over the internet, instead of on paper, go for it.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="infslide">
								<h2>8. Buy an electric car</h2>
								<p>

									This is more of an extreme solution, but if you are in need of a new car, instead of buying a gas powered car, try to buy an electric powered car. If an electric car is too expensive, and out of your budget, you could try buying a hybrid, electric and gas car mix, to help reduce your carbon emissions.

								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="infslide">
								<h2>9. Use a reusable shopping bag.</h2>
								<p>
									By using a reusable shopping bag, you won't have to use the plastic bags. Each time you go shopping without a reusable bag, on average you tend to have about 10 new plastic bags, and using a reusable bag will be 10 less bags being thrown away into the environment.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="infslide">
								<h2>10. Use bamboo products.</h2>
								<p>
									If you use a plastic toothbrush, and then throw it out, it will take close to 400 years for it to decompose. If you switch to a bamboo toothbrush thought, since it is plant based, it will decompose much faster, and leave less waste.
